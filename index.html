                Biking, a popular recreational and sport activity, involves riding bicycles, human-powered vehicles with
                two wheels. It combines exercise, transportation, and leisure. Biking offers a low-impact cardiovascular
                workout that strengthens muscles, improves balance, and promotes overall well-being.

                It's an eco-friendly mode of transportation that reduces carbon emissions and congestion. From leisurely
                rides through scenic landscapes to intense mountain biking challenges, the activity caters to a wide
                range of preferences and skill levels. Biking fosters a sense of freedom, allowing riders to explore
                their surroundings at their own pace. It's not only a physical endeavor but also a way to connect with
                nature and experience the world up close.

            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Paragliding is an exhilarating adventure sport that involves flying a lightweight, non-motorized,
                foot-launched glider. Participants, known as paragliders, harness the power of wind and thermals to soar
                through the sky.
                <br>
                <br>
                The glider's design resembles a parachute, with a fabric wing and lines attached to a harness worn by
                the pilot. Paragliding offers a unique perspective, allowing individuals to glide gracefully above
                landscapes, mountains, and coastal areas. It requires skill in reading wind conditions, as pilots
                navigate using shifts in air currents. The sport combines adrenaline and serenity, providing an
                extraordinary way to experience the sensation of flight and connect with the natural world.

            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Surfing is a dynamic water sport that involves riding ocean waves using a specially designed board.
                Surfers paddle out to the lineup, where they wait for the right wave to catch. Once a suitable wave is
                spotted, they use their body and balance to ride the wave's face, executing maneuvers and turns to
                maintain control and maximize the experience.
                <br>
                <br>
                Surfing demands a connection with the ocean, as surfers must read wave patterns, timing, and currents.
                It's a blend of physical prowess, skill, and a deep appreciation for nature's power. The sport fosters a
                strong sense of camaraderie among surfers and a profound connection to the sea.
